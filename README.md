# DataScienceJob
Context
This data set was originated from the need of understanding the relation between students qualifications and other factors which determine his chance to land a job in Data Science Industry. The idea is to perform analysis of the industry as well as to provide a tool for  the University for understanding what is required for recent grads to be able to be strong and join the workforce.

The initial version of the data set contains job title, city, company, qualifications, masters field, subjects etc. Currently, it has about 10,000 jobs that were bagged by students who pursued masters in various fields from the university of Utah.

I have used Pandas and regula expression to perform analysis of the positions offered and to correlate the offerings to other variables like major of their study, geographic location etc.
The ultimate goal is to provide students with perspective on the value of their degree and qualifications and correlate it with the probability of them getting a job in Data Science field.
